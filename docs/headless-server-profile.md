# Headless Server Profile

This profile is for a dedicated server or copied Sync vault. It keeps the stable release posture: read-only first, guarded writes only after the read-only profile is proven.

## Contract

- Use a dedicated or copied vault, not the live desktop vault.
- Keep Obsidian Headless Sync in `pull-only` for the first server validation.
- Keep Optimike MCP in `headless-readonly` until list/read/search/tasks/Bases/status are green.
- Keep MCP cache outside the synchronized vault.
- Use vault exclusions for operational noise, but do not rely on them to stop Obsidian Sync downloads.
- Do not claim Desktop parity. Delete, frontmatter tags, and minimal Bases writes exist in `headless-filesystem` as bounded filesystem features, not as Obsidian Desktop behavior.

## Environment

```bash
OBSIDIAN_RUNTIME_MODE=headless-readonly
OBSIDIAN_VAULT=/path/to/dedicated-or-copied-vault
OBSIDIAN_CACHE_SOURCE=filesystem
OBSIDIAN_SHARED_CACHE_DB_PATH=/path/outside/vault/shared-cache.sqlite
OBSIDIAN_ENABLE_CACHE=true
MCP_WRITE_MODE=readonly
OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS="tmp/**,**/tmp/**,**/screenshots/**,**/*screenshots*/**"
SEMANTIC_SEARCH_PREWARM=false
```

## Validation

```bash
npm run build
npm run test:runtime
HEADLESS_SERVER_VAULT=/path/to/dedicated-or-copied-vault \
HEADLESS_SERVER_CACHE_DIR=.tmp/headless-server-profile-cache \
npm run smoke:headless-server-profile
```

The server-profile smoke checks that:

- the server starts in `headless-readonly`;
- write/live tools are not registered;
- `obsidian_runtime_maintenance refresh_all` works;
- runtime status reports readonly write policy;
- list/read/tasks run against the vault;
- local Bases fallback is available.

## Guarded Writes

Only after the read-only server profile is green:

1. Switch a copied or dedicated vault to `OBSIDIAN_RUNTIME_MODE=headless-guarded`.
2. Keep `MCP_WRITE_MODE=guarded`.
3. Create a new sandbox draft only.
4. Require `expectedHash` or `expectedMtime` for follow-up edits.
5. Confirm stale hash and traversal writes are blocked.

## Filesystem Features

Only after the `headless-guarded` step, switch a copied or dedicated vault to `OBSIDIAN_RUNTIME_MODE=headless-filesystem`.

1. For delete, require `expectedHash` or `expectedMtime`.
2. For tags, limit the contract to YAML frontmatter `tags`.
3. For Bases, limit the contract to `.base` YAML files and Markdown frontmatter properties.
4. Validate with `npm run smoke:headless-filesystem`.

Never use this phase to edit existing production notes until the server profile has its own rollback and monitoring story.
